### ðŸ‘‹  Hi there, I am Claude 

I am a software developer based in Toronto, ON. 

I am focused on backend development and I am interested in event driven architecture, data streamings, (near) real time systems, data storage, resilience and scalability. 

Java/Kotlin are my go to languages though I am also proficient in Ruby and can find my around in Typescript. Lately I've been playing around with Rust.
