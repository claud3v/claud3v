### 👋   Hi there, I am Claude 

I am a software developer based in Toronto, ON. 

I am focused on backend development and am interested in event driven architecture, data streaming, (near) real time systems, resilience and scalability. 

Java/Kotlin are my go to languages. I am proficient in Ruby and can find my around Typescript. Lately I've been dabbling in Rust.
